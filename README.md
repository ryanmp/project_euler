=============

I'm posting my solutions to a set of math/programming problems. The [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) 
problems are pretty fun & interesting and are perfect for a daily warmup before diving into more complicated 
problem solving and coding. How's that for a glowing recommendation?
